Task 1: 
The wallet address 1FWQiwK27EnGXb6BiBMRLJvunJQZZPMcGd was selected from Blockchain.com. For analysis, the most recent 10 transactions were queried using the public blockchain API. These transactions involved 10 unique counterparty wallets, and a simple transaction network was plotted to visualise the flow of funds. Based on this sample, there were no clear signs of suspicious or illicit activity.

Task 2: 
For the token-level analysis, the cryptocurrency PEPE was chosen. Historical 30-day price and volume data was downloaded from CoinMarketCap and analysed. The choice of this token was motivated by the presence of two pronounced peaks in the time series data. Both the time series plots (price and trading volume) and the daily volume heatmap show sudden, extreme surges in activity: 22 August 2025 and 13 September 2025

On these dates, PEPE experienced unusually high trading volumes and sharp one-day price increases, immediately followed by steep declines. This pattern is consistent with pump-and-dump behaviour, where a large coordinated buy artificially inflates price, followed by rapid selling. These anomalies stand out against the background of relatively stable trading activity, making them credible red-flag events worth flagging as potential cases of market manipulation.
