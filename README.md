# HTX_internTHA

Hi, my name is Jowena and I am a final-year Business Analytics student at the NUS School of Computing. I specialise in both Finance and Machine Learning, and I am passionate about applying data analytics to generate meaningful insights. I envision building my career at the intersection of data and decision-making, which is why I applied to HTXâ€”I believe it will provide me with valuable exposure and hands-on experience. Outside of academics, I enjoy travelling and have a keen interest in discovering good food wherever I go. :)

Attached above are the files for the jupyter notebook, plots for the different tasks as well as the 30days data for crypto token PEPE 

Task 1: 
The wallet address 1FWQiwK27EnGXb6BiBMRLJvunJQZZPMcGd was selected from Blockchain.com. For analysis, the most recent 10 transactions were queried using the public blockchain API. These transactions involved 10 unique counterparty wallets, and a simple transaction network was plotted to visualise the flow of funds. Based on this sample, there were no clear signs of suspicious or illicit activity.

Task 2: 
For the token-level analysis, the cryptocurrency PEPE was chosen. Historical 30-day price and volume data was downloaded from CoinMarketCap and analysed. The choice of this token was motivated by the presence of two pronounced peaks in the time series data. Both the time series plots (price and trading volume) and the daily volume heatmap show sudden, extreme surges in activity: 22 August 2025 and 13 September 2025

On these dates, PEPE experienced unusually high trading volumes and sharp one-day price increases, immediately followed by steep declines. This pattern is consistent with pump-and-dump behaviour, where a large coordinated buy artificially inflates price, followed by rapid selling. These anomalies stand out against the background of relatively stable trading activity, making them credible red-flag events worth flagging as potential cases of market manipulation.
